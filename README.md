# Glycan_Project
All refined tools used in my project

###Some statistical tools are based on pGlyco results.
**Statistical**
  This tool supports txt/excel/csv format file and will output the count number of glycoprotein, glycopeptide, glycosite and glycan. 
  Becuase this script is written for pGlyco results, so columns with name "Proteins, "ProSites", "Glycan(H,N,A,G,F,pH)" are required.
